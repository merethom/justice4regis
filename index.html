      <p>
        Demand justice by emailing pertinent politicians to voice your support for a full enquiry by the Special Investigations Unit and to call for the results of any such enquiries to be made publicly available. Each link will open a new window in your email client with a prewritten email message to the person whoâ€™s name appears on the button. You can edit the text to personalize these messages or you can simply sign your name and hit send. You can also donate on her family's gofundme page.
